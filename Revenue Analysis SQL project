The Hotel Data Analysis and Property Optimization Project is a comprehensive data analysis initiative aimed at optimizing the performance and profitability of a chain of hotels.
This project involves in-depth data analysis of various aspects of the hotel business, ranging from occupancy rates and revenue generation to booking behaviors and guest
satisfaction. The primary goal of this project is to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities that will help the hotel management make 
informed decisions and implement effective strategies to improve overall performance and guest satisfaction

```
1- What is the overall occupancy rate for each hotel can you identify which hotels have consistently high or low occupancy rates?

SELECT
    dh.property_name AS hotel_name,
    SUM(fb.successful_bookings) AS total_bookings,
    dh.category AS hotel_category,
    SUM(fb.capacity) AS total_capacity,
    ROUND((SUM(fb.successful_bookings) / SUM(fb.capacity)) * 100, 2) AS occupancy_rate
FROM facts_agg_bookings fb

GROUP BY dh.property_name, dh.category
ORDER BY occupancy_rate DESC
limit 10;

2- Which room category had the highest revenue generated across all properties, 
and can you list the top three properties that contributed the most to this revenue?

select fb.property_id , dm.room_id , sum(revenue_generated) as total_revenue_generated
